"those chunks of molten iron which we draw from the furnaces and cast into the teeth of cylinders that turn more rapidly than the wind. These furnaces emit a liquid fire that, in its boiling and heaving, throws off a shower of glowing drops into the air; and from the teeth of the cylinder, iron emerges drastically reduced. We too, in truth, are hard pressed like these masses of iron."
